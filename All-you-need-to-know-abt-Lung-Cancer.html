                                            Smoking damages the lungs in many ways. It disintegrates the alveolar sacs and leads to emphysema. The reduced surface area makes smokers hungry for air due to which they cough repeatedly to clear the airways. Thus, have a typical “smoker’s cough”.

                                <p>Lung cancer is divided into 2 different types based on histology and method of spread. The types are as follows:</p>

                               <ul class="list">
                                   <li>Small cell-lung carcinomas (SCLC) that are most differentiated, divide aggressively and present themselves without invasion into the bronchus. Makeup about 20% of all lung cancers.</li>
                                    <li>Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) that are not much differentiated, are proximal in location and have a rapid spread too. Make up less than 10% of lung cancers.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Adenocarcinomas (contribute about 25-30% of lung cancers) and Bronchioalveolar cancers are further divisions of cancer that are based on the location of cancer Squamous cell lung cancers makeup about 30% of all lung cancers.</p>
                             
                                <h2>Signs and symptoms of lung cancer</h2>
                                <p>Lung cancer can present itself in different forms. The signs and symptoms of Lung cancer vary depending on the type and area of tumour growth but generally, these symptoms are seen commonly:</p>
                                
                                <ul class="list">
                                    <li>Cough</li>
                                    <li>Chest pain</li>
                                    <li>Wheezing</li>
                                    <li>Dyspnea (shortness of breath)</li>
                                    <li>Hemoptysis (blood in sputum)</li>
                                    <li> pneumonia (post stenotic) and bronchitis</li>
                                    <li>Pleural and pericardial effusion</li>
                                    <li>Weight loss</li>
                                    <li>Fatigue and fever</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Lung cancer is notorious for spreading out to different visceral organs and that too at a rapid rate. When spread it may present with symptoms of the distant metastases which may include bone pains, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy and headaches.</p>

                                <h2>Stages of lung cancer</h2>
                                <p>Lung cancer is divided into stages to better understand the progression of the disease. The NSCLC has 4 stages that are:</p>
                                <h4>Stage-1</h4>
                                <p>The tumor resides inside the lungs and hasn’t spread outside the lungs.</p>

                                <h4>Stage-2</h4>
                               <p>Cancer is inside the lungs, has gone near the lymph nodes but not invaded it.</p>

                               <h4>Stage-3</h4>
                               <p>Cancer has invaded the mediastinal lymph nodes (lymph nodes in the middle of the chest) </p>
                               <ul>
                                   <li><h5>Stage-3A</h5></li>
                                   <p>Cancer has invaded the mediastinal lymph nodes (lymph nodes in the middle of the chest) </p>
                                   <li><h5>Stage-3B</h5> </li>
                                   <p>Cancer has is now found in lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest.</p>
                               </ul>

                                <h4>Stage-4</h4>
                                <p>Cancer has metastasized into both lungs or even distant organs such as liver, brain, etc.</p>
                               <p>On the other hand, SCLC has only two main stages. A limited-stage means cancer resides in only one lung, is near to but hasn’t invaded the lymph nodes.
                                Conditions worse than this come under the extensive stage. In this stage, cancer may be spread throughout the lung or to the opposite lung and distant organs.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Causes and risk factors</h2>

                                <p>Cancer is a mysterious disease that has no definitive cause. Lung cancer is no exception. The exact causes are unknown but still, doctors have identified certain risk factors that can lead to the development of lung cancer.</p>
                                <h3>Smoking</h3>
                                <p>Tobacco smoke is considered to be the leading cause of lung cancer. Cigarette smoke is the most common form of tobacco consumption. Therefore, the cigarette is the biggest culprit in causing lung cancer.
                                    80-90% of all lung cancers are caused by smoking. According to reports, 81% of deaths due to Lung cancer in US adults (over 30 years of age) were attributed to cigarette smoking. 
                                    </p>
