Hence one bacterium can become 2 just in 15 minutes. This means that within 6 hours, bacterium can multiply to over 16 million. Some bacteria need to grow to  high levels to be harmful, while some needed very low numbers. However, viruses are not grown in food and water, these are  vehicles for transmission.

                                            <p class="lead">Now we discuss symptoms of food borne diseases. The commonest symptoms are stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms depend on the cause of the disease. Symptoms may occure very quickly after eating the food (most probably chemical poisons) or may take days even weeks to appear, For most food borne diseases symptoms occur 24 - 72 hours after the food has been eaten. It is estimated that 3% of cases of food borne cases can lead to long - term health problems.
                                                Very secure diseases including cancer, arthritis and neurological disorders can be caused by contaminated foods therefore it is very e important to take medical advice

                                                <p class="lead">All over the world are doing their best to improve the safety of the food supply because food borne diseases remain a significant health issue in both developed and developing countries. World health organization plays the major role in this. Therefore, they introduce five keys to safer foods. Therefore, stop microorganisms growing in foods and making people sick by following five keys to safer foods.</p>
