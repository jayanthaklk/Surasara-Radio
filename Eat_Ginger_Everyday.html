                               <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Why Ginger?</h2>
                               <p class="lead">Ginger, as mentioned above, has a very concentrated, sharp flavor, containing various vitamins and minerals.
                                Gingerol, zingiberene and shogaol is also present in ginger.
                                </p>

                               <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Gingerol</h3>
                               <p class="lead">Gingerol is the main bioactive compound in ginger, responsible for much of its medicinal properties. Ginger is high in gingerol.
                                Main bio-active substance contributing to the treatments of nausea and vomiting and arthritis, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Zingiberene</h3>
                                <p class="lead">Zingiberene helps in smooth digestion.
                                    Shogaol:
                                    Gives the ginger its analgesic properties making it a painkiller, helping against heart disease and cancer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="lead">All these factors along with its anti-diabetic effect contribute to the medicinal properties of ginger. For thousands of years, this condiment was used as a treatment for numerous maladies such as migraines, simple colds, arthritis, etc. and of course eating this delectably healthy spice every day for a month helps keep your immune system strong and your body, in turn, healthy.</p>

                                            Now of course, eating ginger everyday for a month doesn’t mean you must nibble small pieces of the ginger little by little, like a bird. You can add cut pieces of ginger to your dishes during your breakfast, lunch or dinner. Each day, cut a slice about 1.5 centimeters, into small pieces and add it to your breakfast smoothie, pasta dish, Asian dish, soup or any dish of your choice. Not only will this add an amazingly piquant taste to your dish, but will also help boost your immune system when practiced continuously for a month.

                                <p class="lead">Did you know that inflammation is actually the body’s own natural self-preservation function? The anti-inflammatory effect of ginger helps reduce inflammation caused by chemicals, germs and a poor diet that is harmful to the body.</p>
                                <p class="lead">Gingerols substances are believed to explain why so many people with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis experience reductions in their pain levels and improvements in their mobility when they consume ginger regularly. In two clinical studies involving patients who responded to conventional drugs and those who didn’t, physicians found that 75% of arthritis patients and 100% of patients with muscular discomfort experienced relief of pain and/or swelling.</p>

                                <p class="lead">Ginger has the ability to help lessen nausea. It is especially useful in relieving nausea in patients undergoing chemotherapy and after surgery. Pregnancy related nausea like morning sickness can be reduced by a little bit of ginger in the diet each day (1-1.5 grams). However, if pregnant, consult your doctor before consuming large amounts.</p>
                                <p class="lead">Ginger’s anti-vomiting action has been shown to be very useful in reducing the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, even the most severe form, <link><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hyperemesis-gravidarum" target="_blank">hyperemesis gravidarum</a> , a condition which usually requires hospitalization. In a double-blind trial, ginger root brought about a significant reduction in both the severity of nausea and number of attacks of vomiting in 19 of 27 women in early pregnancy (less than 20 weeks). Unlike antivomiting drugs, which can cause severe birth defects, ginger is extremely safe, and only a small dose is required.</p>

                                    </p>

                                        Well, ginger helps speed up the process of digestion and eases stomach discomfort, doing a lot of good for your bowel movements. A clue to ginger’s success in eliminating gastrointestinal distress is offered by recent double-blind studies, which have demonstrated that ginger is very effective in preventing the symptoms of motion sickness, especially seasickness.

                                            <p class="lead">Ginger can not only be warming on a cold day, but can help promote healthy sweating, which is often helpful during colds and flus. A good sweat may do a lot more than simply assist detoxification. German researchers have recently found that sweat contains a potent germ-fighting agent that may help fight off infections.</p>
                                            <p class="lead">Investigators have isolated the gene responsible for the compound and the protein it produces, which they have named dermicidin. Dermicidin is manufactured in the body’s sweat glands, secreted into the sweat, and transported to the skin’s surface where it provides protection against invading microorganisms, including bacteria such as E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (a common cause of skin infections), and fungi, including Candida albicans.</p>

                                            <p class="lead">Ginger is one of the only spices that provide both nutritional factors as well as a scrumptiously strong taste. A little bit of ginger everyday for a whole month can bring a lot of change and boost your immune system.</p>
